# Intellify Assignment
This code is a part of an assignment given by Intellify for an assignment where I have to develop a full-stack interactive dashboard application using Next.js, Recharts, and Supabase. The dashboard should display various metrics, allow user authentication, and provide data visualization capabilities.

## Setup 
To locally run this project , you can go to your CLI and run the following command :

`git clone https://github.com/DhruvGahoi/dashboard-app`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`
